# C++ Examples

This holds the C++ examples for my [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/@thatprogrammerguy/featured).

The easiest way to get setup is to download the repository as a zip file, extract it, and then to open the desired example folder using either [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)'s "Open CMake Project" (Windows Only) or using [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/).
